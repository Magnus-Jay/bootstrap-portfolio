# bootstrap-portfolio

Welcome to my project showcasing what I have learned in the class thus far!

In this portfolio I have created three separate pages that are constructed of HTML, bootstrap, and some CSS styling.

Some original styling I have done are some custom googlwe fonts in the headers, as well as color choices.

Additionally my index page does contain original information about my bio/

Please let me know if you have any questions, would love to know what you think!
